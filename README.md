# Rust Raytracer

This is project is my attempt to build simple renderer using rust. 
It's heavily inspired by 
[Writing a Raytracer in Rust](https://bheisler.github.io/post/writing-raytracer-in-rust-part-1/) by Brook Heisler and  [Raytracer in One Weekend](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8) by Peter Shirley.
